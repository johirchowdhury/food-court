                <h3>Spicy Pork</h3>
                <p>I am a salmon lover. This is a great recipe for a slightly exotic flavor of Indian inspiration with a
                    maple twist. The flavor is exceptional, delicious, and unique. Orange zest may be added for an extra
                    flavor twist. </p>

                <h3>Tenderloin with Apples</h3>
                <p>Jazz up your pork tenderloin with this spicy-sweet combo of apples, cider, sweet potatoes, and as
                    much or as little heat as your palate requires! This easy oven dish only needs one other pot to
                    reduce the sauce on top of the stove.</p>

                    enough for a crowd or for leftovers later in the week. Add a green veggie or a salad, and some
                    crusty dinner bread, and you are good to go!</p>
